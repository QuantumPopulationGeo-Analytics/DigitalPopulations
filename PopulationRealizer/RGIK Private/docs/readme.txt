
== What is "RGIK Private"? ==

We wish to keep some algorithms away from the public.  This project is a repository for code developed at CERL, for use only by CERL.  This code must not be copied to the public SourceForge repository.  Ideally, there should not even be clues in the public repository that this private code base exists.

The only application in this repository is CensusGenCS, an extension to ConflatePumsQueryWithTracts that adds conditional simulation to the process.  Conditional simulation allows the user to provide a partial "answer" (i.e. data which would normally be computed by the program).  The program adapts its own answer around the given data, and folds that data into the generated output files.
