The RGIK contains a number of sample projects in the 'projects' package.  This 
directory contains the matching data files for those projects.

Outputs from these runs are placed in build/project-outputs.  Although these 
outputs aren't really build products, 'build' is our standard scratchpad area 
for files we don't need to save.
