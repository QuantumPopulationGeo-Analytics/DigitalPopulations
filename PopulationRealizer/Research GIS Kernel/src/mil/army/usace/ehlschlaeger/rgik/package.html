<H3>The Research Geographic Information Kernel.</H3>
<P>
The RGIK is a self-contained library for manipulating geographic
information.  The primary purpose of this library is to support
Ehlschlaeger team research projects, so there's no formal spec
for what it does.
</P>
<P>
This is not a GIS "system" -- it's not intended to be a complete environment for
working with geographic info, but rather an environment for performing deep
research into certain aspects of GIS algorithms.
</P>
<P>
RGIK is not built on top of a GIS, as it's low-level classes may contain
features not found in other systems.
