CHUCK'S SKETCH:

Relationship File:
 - ask for:
   - Land use map
   A Census Tract ASC
   B Census Tract CSV
   C Household Info CSV
   D Population Info CSV
 - Determine which land use classes are not lived on
 - Determine which land use classes are the same
 - connect A-B: Find column that represents values in ASC
 - connect serial # of C to serial # of D
 - connect each column in B to columns in C & D
 - allow for description of columns to be typed in

Pums Query File:
 - seperate from Relationship File



CHUCK'S SECOND SKETCH:

above is incomplete, we really need:

 - Census numerator
 - Census denominator
 - Pums column
 - Pums min
 - Pums max



PUMSQUERY FILE:
"DP fitting criteria"

NO:
RACBLK=1 and SEX=2 and 50<=AGEP<=64
weights go here  (0,1]

YES:
  list of col specs copied from rel file
  how to AND/OR
  weights
