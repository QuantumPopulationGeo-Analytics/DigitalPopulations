
Simple Hand-Made Distro of DPGUI

 * To avoid requiring users to install Netbeans, the compiled app is kept in dir "runnable", which is checked into SVN.  To build:
 
   * In NetBeans, click Run->Clean and Build Main Project.
   * Copy resulting jar from dist/DPGUI.jar into runnable.
   * Check it into SVN.

 * Contrary to Netbean's own docs, required libs are NOT copied into dist\lib.  build.xml must be hand-modified to support this.  Instead, we simply hand-copy the required libs here and check them in.
