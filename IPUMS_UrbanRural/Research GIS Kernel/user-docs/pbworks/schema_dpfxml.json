Can contain 'cluster' and 'match' elements in any order.\n&nbsp; |\n  | &lt;cluster&gt; elements instruct this phase to introduce a degree of clustering\n  | by moving \"similar\" households closer to each other.  The referenced trait\n  | provides a definition of \"similar\", and the remaining attributes specify an\n  | amount of clustering.\n  |   id:\n  |     Identifier for one of the &lt;trait&gt; elements above.  Clustering rules will\n  |     be derived from this trait.  Trait must be a normal tract-based trait\n  |     (i.e. one with 'regionTrait' and 'regionTotal'.)\n &nbsp;|   reduction:\n  |     Percentage reduction in \"inertia,\" which is a measure of the randomness\n  |     of an arrangement of households.  A reduction of inertia is an increase\n  |     of clustering, and is achieved by moving households closer together.\n  |     Goal will be this much lower than the \"inertia\" values calculated when\n  |     phase 4 begins.\n&nbsp; |   distance:\n&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;   Maximum size of clusters to build. Only houses within this radius will be\n&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;   considered for clustering.&nbsp; 1000 meters or 0.01 degrees is a good starting\n&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;   point.  This values is in the same units as the input maps.\n  |\n  | &lt;match&gt; elements instruct the phase to use a referenced trait exactly as\n  | specified.  These elements are considered constraints, and households will\n  | only be moved to locations permitted by all &lt;match&gt; elements together.  If\n  | the system is over-specified and the elements collectively forbid all\n  | locations in a tract, then the 'rank' field is used to find an acceptable\n  | solution.\n<\/pre><pre>  |   id:\n  |     Identifier for one of the &lt;trait&gt; elements above.  Trait must be an\n  |     attribute map (i.e. with 'attribute' field) as this is the only kind\n  |     of trait that has enough precision to work here.\n  |   rank:\n  |     Optional integer that specifies the order in which &lt;match&gt; elements are\n  |     to be used.  Elements are processed in this order:\n  |       * First, elements with 'rank', and in numeric order (low to high).\n  |       * After, elements without 'rank', and in the order they appear in\n  |         the fitting-criteria file.\n  |\n  | Note that &lt;match&gt; elements are order-independent -- the same\n  | result is produced no matter the order in which these elements are\n  | applied.  The 'rank' field is only used when attribute maps are over specified,\n  | and the system cannot find a location that satisfies all &lt;match&gt;\n  | elements simultaneously.  In that case, only the top elements will be\n  | used, and evaluation will stop with the first element that breaks.\n&nbsp; --&gt;\n&nbsp; &lt;position-rules&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;cluster id=\"1\" reduction=\"50\" distance=\"1000\"\/&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;cluster id=\"3\" reduction=\"50\" distance=\"1000\"\/&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;cluster id=\"4\" reduction=\"50\" distance=\"1000\"\/&gt;\n<\/pre>\n\n<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;match id=\"19\"\/&gt;\n&nbsp; &lt;\/position-rules&gt;\n\n&lt;\/FittingCriteria&gt;\n\n<\/pre>","locked":false,"mtime":1314840383,"name":"schema:dpfxml","oid":26621695,"perms":{"r":true},"revcount":17,"revurl":"http:\/\/digitalpopulations.pbworks.com\/w\/page\/26621695\/schema%3Adpfxml","size":8720,"wikistyle":false}
