Sample projects.
These projects began life as research to help drive the development of the core.
They are kept here as example of some of the things the RGIK can do.

<P>
Data files required by these projects are kept in project-specific directories
under <code>projects</code> in the root of the RGIK system.  If any output files
are generated, they will be written to a project-specific directory under
<code>build</code>, our standard scratchpad area.
